###GildedRose Kata

####What is this?  

The GildedRose kata is an example created for CocoaConf Columbus 2015 for use in a talk by BJ Miller, titled "Testing, Testing, 1..<4". This is an example of using TDD to add supporting tests to an existing project and refactor a legacy code base without breaking functionality.

####If you want to go step by step  
The master branch has tags on it from step0 (the initial step) up to the final tag, with each step advancing the example. Start by typing `git checkout step0` from the command line in the project's directory, and examine the project. Then, type `git checkout step1`, and so on, examining the project at each step and running the unit tests.
